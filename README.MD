Visitor Counter Backend (Azure Function + API Management)

This backend powers the visitor counter for my cloud portfolio site: josephinthe.cloud.

It’s a serverless Azure Function App exposed securely through Azure API Management (APIM), with a persistent database to track visitor counts.

Project Overview

The backend handles each site visit by:

    - Receiving an API call from the frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript).

    - Incrementing a counter stored in the database.

    - Returning the updated visitor count in real time to be displayed on the site.

This project demonstrates cloud-native, production-grade design:

    Serverless Functions – event-driven execution, cost-efficient.

    Azure API Management – secure API gateway with rate limiting and CORS configuration.

    Database Persistence – ensures visitor counts survive restarts and scale events.

    Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) – fully automated deployments.

    CI/CD (GitHub Actions) – test and deploy changes seamlessly.

Tech Stack

    - Language: Python

    - Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

    - Services Used:

        - Azure Function App (HTTP Trigger)

        - Azure API Management

        - Azure CosmosDB / Table API

        - Azure Storage Account (logs & configs)

    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions

    - IaC: Terraform

Key Features

- Visitor Counter API

    Returns updated visitor count

    Persists values in DB

    Handles malformed requests gracefully (returns error response)

    Edge-case handling: initializes counter if missing

    CI pipeline runs on each push

Security

    - API is protected with subscription keys through Azure APIM.

    - Keys are stored securely as GitHub Secrets and injected into CI/CD pipelines.

    - CORS policies configured to only allow my frontend domain.

Why I Built This

I wanted a project that demonstrates real-world cloud engineering skills.

This backend shows:

    - How to securely expose a Function App via APIM

    - How to persist state in a stateless architecture

    - How to automate infrastructure deployments with Terraform

    - How to test and validate APIs with CI/CD pipelines

In other words, it’s a production-ready microservice that happens to run a fun feature (tracking site visitors).

Results

    - Visitors to josephinthe.cloud see a live counter that updates instantly.

    - Backend scales automatically with traffic.
